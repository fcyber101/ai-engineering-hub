**HISTORY OF OUR Company -** TechNova Solutions

Founded in 2020 by Jack Chen and Maria Rodriguez, TechNova Solutions
began as a two-person operation in a shared coworking space. The company
originally focused on providing AI-powered data analysis tools for small
businesses.

In 2021, TechNova secured \$500,000 in seed funding from Angel Investors
Network. This allowed the team to expand to 5 employees and develop
their flagship product, \"DataInsight Pro,\" a no-code analytics
platform.

2022 marked a turning point when TechNova landed its first enterprise
client, GlobalRetail Inc. The company grew to 15 employees and moved to
a dedicated office in the downtown tech hub. Revenue reached \$1.2
million.

In 2023, TechNova launched \"DataInsight Enterprise\" and expanded to
European markets. The company now serves 20 enterprise customers across
5 countries and works with 20 specialized suppliers.
